%Dear Professor Wunsch,
%Dear Professor Choi,
%Dear Professor Hurson,
Dear Professor Gosavi,
}

I am writing to invite you to participate in the advisory committee for my PhD dissertation. I am a fellow of the GAANN doctoral program on Information and System Assurance for Critical Infrastructure. I passed my qualifying exam on 15 March, 2014. My PhD advisor is Dr. Sahra Sedigh Sarvestani.

The other committee members are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dr. Donald C. Wunsch II
\item Dr. Minsu Choi
\item Dr. Ali Hurson
%\item Dr. Abhijit Gosavi
\end{itemize}

My research focuses on modeling critical infrastructure cyber-physical systems (CICPS). Because CICPSs are designed using sophisticated intelligent autonomous control to improve performance, they are reliant on real-time field data and vulnerable to corrupted data. Erroneous data can be created within a system through both intentional and unintentional means, such as attacks or component failures. Corrupted data in many of these systems can produce failures resulting in property damage, injury, or loss of life, as well as have economic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the potential for fault propagation and the interdependencies of these systems. My goal is to model how corrupted data propagates through a CICPS, considering potential sources of corruption and using survivability as a metric. This information will be essential to designing and evaluating robust CICPSs. To date I have developed a novel Petri net model which captures the propagation of corrupted data in a sensor network system. Next I will refine the node model to capture more advanced features such as corruption detection and data fusion. I hope to defend by October 2016.

My work will greatly benefit from your expertise in
%Dr Wunsch
%computational intelligence, critical infrastructure, and cyber-security.
%Dr. Choi
%embedded systems, fault tolerance, and reliability modeling \& analysis.
%Dr. Hurson
%distributed systems, databases, and distributed data integration.
%Dr. Gosavi
systems modeling and control.
I would be grateful for your invaluable guidance throughout the remainder of my doctoral work. Please let me know if you would be willing to serve on my advisory committee.

\closing{Very Respectfully,}
