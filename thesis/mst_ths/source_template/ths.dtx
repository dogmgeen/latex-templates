% \subsection{File Description}
%
% Simply \LaTeX\ the \verb|ths.ins| file to generate the template
% files for a publication thesis option format thesis,
% \verb|ptotemplate.tex|, and a \LaTeX-standard report class thesis,
% \verb|rpctemplate.tex|, along with five variants of a thesis
% chapter. The variants include text only (\verb|chapmin.tex|), floats
% (\verb|chapflt.tex|), bibliography citations (\verb|chapbib|),
% nomenclature entries (\verb|chapglo.tex|), and all of the above
% (\verb|chapall.tex|).  The inclusion or removal of these various
% chapter templates allows one to verify a local \LaTeX\ installation
% and the associated compile stages.
%
% This documentation file (\verb|ths.dtx|) can
% be typeset by running it through \LaTeX.
% 
% \emph{Very important:} the \verb|<ps>| characters which appear in
% the code are simply a placeholder for a percent sign (\LaTeX\
% comment character).  These characters are used so that during the
% generation of the code output, these lines are not removed.  Bottom
% line, after \LaTeX'ing the \verb|ths.ins| file, do a replace all for
% \verb|<ps>| with \verb|%| to obtain a proper \LaTeX\ file.
%
% \subsection{Limitations and Bugs}
% 
% \begin{description} 
% \item [Added: 2014/10/21] The documentation text may not accurately
% reflect the current form of the code.  The code, however, is correct
% and produces properly functioning templates.
% \item [Added: 2011/10/24] 
%  The co-adviser specification does not work as indicated by the 
%  original template.  The command must have an error in it as the
%    command desires an argument, but when one is provided, it adds
%    the designation co-adviser to the committee memberone.
% \item [Resolved (Originally Added: 2011/11/03).] The first page of
%   each individual appendix in a thesis with multiple appendices is
%   not correctly generated in LaTeX.  At the moment, this would
%   require generating these pages outside of LaTeX.  The associated
%   class file will need revision in order to make these pages
%   generate with the correct formatting.
% \item [Added: 2008/01/23, Resolved: 2011/07/12]
%  At present the rpctemplate.tex will not be a function template.
%  This can be developed later on an as needed basis.  The intended
%  difference between the two templates is that the \verb|ptotemplate|
%  is a thesis based on the publication option whereas the
%  \verb|rpctemplate| is a thesis based on the report class and not
%  based on separately generated publication- formatted
%  manuscripts. 
% \end{description}
%
% \section{Hints for Final Edit Stage}
%
% The last stages of editing a thesis often come down to treating
%    widow and orphan lines.  The following are hints for addressing
%    these final issues:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use \verb|\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}| command.
% \item Add a \verb|\newpage| command to force the start of a new page
%    at a specific point.
% \item LaTeX has a parameter for 'penalty' for widows and orphans 
%    ('club lines' in LaTeX terminology). With the greater penalty
%    LaTeX will try more to avoid widows and orphans. You can try to 
%    increase these penalties by putting following commands in your 
%    document preamble:
%    \verb|\widowpenalty=300\clubpenalty=300|. If this does not help,
%    you can try increasing these values even more, to a maximum of 
%    10000. However, it is not recommended to set this value too high, 
%    as setting it to 10000 forbids LaTeX from doing this altogether, 
%    which might result in strange behavior.
% \item Although I have not tested this, Wikipedia suggests it also 
%    helps to have rubber band values for the space between paragraphs:
%    \verb|\setlength{\parskip}{3ex plus 2ex minus 2ex}|.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \section{\LaTeX\ Template for Standard Report Class Thesis}
%
% \subsection{Description}

% This template represents a thesis generated as a single report class
% document.
%
% I have used the \texttt{chapter} and \texttt{chapter*} commands to
% produce both chapter titles and titles for the frontmatter and
% backmatter.  In my opinion this is the easiest and most transparent
% method to produce absolutely uniform type and layout.  The thesis
% style files that I received tried to accomplish this using custom
% defined commands but the result was not satisfactory, in my opinion.
% The \texttt{chapter*} command produces no numbering, which is in
% fact true for any of the sectioning commands.
%
% One change which you, as a user, may wish to make is in the relative
% locations of the files.  For \LaTeX\, all relative file locations
% have to be given with respect to the file that will be compiled by
% \LaTeX. Thus, if it is desired to have chapter files in
% sub-directories of the directory containing the base \verb|*.tex|
% file, the include commands will need to be of a form such as
% \verb|\include{subdir/foo.tex}|. This same logic also applies to the
% locations used to specify the *.eps files in each of the chapter's
% \texttt{*.tex} files.  
% 
% The contents of \texttt{template.tex} are expected to be rather
% transparent.  The only thing that may be worth further explanation
% is the use of the \texttt{include} and \texttt{includeonly} commands
% instead of \texttt{input}.  The reason is that the
% include/includeonly combination allows one to conditionally load the
% files.  This can save time when only one chapter, or portion of the
% thesis, is begin worked on at a given time. The only danger to this
% approach is that if a given chapter is not part of the include only
% list, then its impact on pagination, lists of figures, tables, etc
% will be frozen.  A final run with all of the include files part of
% of the includeonly list will ensure a complete document.

% \section{\LaTeX\ Template for Publication Thesis Option}
%
% \subsection{Using the Template}
%
% The steps in using the Publication Thesis Option template are the
% following
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item In each \verb|ppr.tex| file, change the class options
%   in the documentclass command to 
%   \verb|\documentclass[times,thesis]{journal}| where \emph{journal}
%   is the name of the journal the paper formatted for.  Once the class
%   options have been changed, re-make the file.  This should produce a 
%   postscript file with margins and pagination obeying the thesis
%   requirements.
% \item In each \verb|ppr.tex| file, add the following command
%   \verb|\setcounter{page}{x}| immediately following the 
%   \verb|\begin{document}| command, where \emph{x} is the starting page
%   number for the corresponding paper.  Now re-make each of the 
%   \verb|ppr.tex| files.  The result should be a thesis body with each of
%   the papers consituting it numbered consecutively.
% \item Edit the thesis.tex template by entering the correct paper names
%   and so on.  Compile the thesis template with the make command. Make
%   sure the pagination for the table of contents entries with the 
%   thesis body are correct.  Note that in the template, the setcounter
%   command will need to be issued with the correct page number corresponding
%   to each individual paper.
% \item Add (or uncomment) the \verb|\nofiles| command to the template
%   immediately preceding the \verb|\begin{document}| command.  This
%   command prevents \LaTeX\ from writing any changes to the 
%   \verb|.toc,.lof,.lot| files.  
% \item Add the entire contents from each \verb|ppr.lof| and \verb|ppr.lot|
%   to the corresponding template \verb|.lof| or \verb|.lot| file, at the 
%   appropriate place in these files.  Then recompile the 
%   template and be sure the the list of figures and list of tables entries
%   generated are correct.
% \item Now, go back to the individual \verb|ppr.tex| files and add
%   the \verb|\tableofcontents| command to each and re-make them.  Now
%   copy the contents of each of these individual \verb|.toc| files
%   to the \verb|.toc| file of the thesis template. Re-make the thesis.
% \item Print out the \verb|ppr.ps| files and the \verb|thesis.ps| files, 
%   put them in order and you have a complete thesis.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% \subsection{Additional Notes and Hints}
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item If the bibliography in an individual entry needs to be edited
%   directly, edit the \verb|ppr.bbl| file but make sure not to re-run
%   the bibtex command because otherwise the changes will be overwritten.
% \item The \verb|nofiles| command cannot be used in the individual
%   \verb|ppr.tex| files since otherwise the nomenclature is not generated.
% \item In the thesis list of tables and list of illustrations, only an
%   abbreviated caption should appear.  This can be accomplished by editing
%   the \verb|.lof| and \verb|.lot| files.  Preferably, however, it can be
%   accomplished by using the following form of the caption command:
%   \verb|\caption[lst_entry]{heading}| where \verb|lst_entry| is the
%   abbreviated entry which is to appear in the list of figures or tables.
%   This can be the first sentence of the extended caption or an 
%   even more abbreviated version.
% \item The individual entries in the list of figures and tables for 
%   each paper must be set off by the following 
%   \verb|\noindent\mbox{PAPER 1\hfill}\nopagebreak|.  This should be 
%   added to the \verb|.lot| and \verb|.lof| files.
% \item The block of entries the \verb|.toc| must also be set off by a
%   command identical to the above.  In addition, this should be
%   preceded by \verb|\addvspace{\baselineskip}|.
% \item The list of figures and tables must also have single-spaced 
%   entries with doublespacing between the entries.  A way to 
%   accomplish this is to put the \verb|\singlespacing| command as the
%   second line of the \verb|.lot| and \verb|.lof| files and add,
%   immediately in front of each contentsline command, the following:
%   \verb|\addvspace{\baselineskip}|.  This same command will need to
%   be added in front of each of the above Paper x commands so that 
%   there is a blank line between the last entry of one paper and 
%   the line that says \verb|Paper x+1|.
% \item The entries in the table of contents must also be single spaced
%   for each entry and double-spaced between.  However, it is easier to
%   just let the table of contents be double-spaced and then put an
%   individual table of contents inside a singlespacing environment, if
%   it requires more than one line.

% the fig, tbl, bib citation and glo entry samples were moved into
% separate chunks, which themselves constitute a separate section.  A
% minimal chapter can then have fig, tbl, bib and/or glo content added
